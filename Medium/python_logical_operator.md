Logical operators in Python are used to perform logical operations on boolean values (`True` and `False`). These operators evaluate conditions and return a boolean result (`True` or `False`).

Here is a detailed guide on Python logical operators, including their syntax, behavior, and examples.

---

## **Logical Operators Overview**

Python supports three logical operators:

| Operator | Description                                                                     | Syntax Example |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `and`    | Returns `True` if **both** conditions are true.                                 | `A and B`      |
| `or`     | Returns `True` if **at least one** condition is true.                           | `A or B`       |
| `not`    | Negates the condition. Returns `True` if the condition is false and vice versa. | `not A`        |

---

### **1. `and` Operator**

The `and` operator evaluates two expressions and returns `True` if **both** are true. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

#### Syntax:

```python
A and B
```

#### Truth Table:

| `A`     | `B`     | `A and B` |
| ------- | ------- | --------- |
| `True`  | `True`  | `True`    |
| `True`  | `False` | `False`   |
| `False` | `True`  | `False`   |
| `False` | `False` | `False`   |

#### Example:

```python
x = 5
y = 10
print(x > 0 and y > 0)  # True (Both conditions are true)
print(x > 0 and y < 0)  # False (Second condition is false)
```

---

### **2. `or` Operator**

The `or` operator evaluates two expressions and returns `True` if **at least one** condition is true. It returns `False` only if **both** conditions are false.

#### Syntax:

```python
A or B
```

#### Truth Table:

| `A`     | `B`     | `A or B` |
| ------- | ------- | -------- |
| `True`  | `True`  | `True`   |
| `True`  | `False` | `True`   |
| `False` | `True`  | `True`   |
| `False` | `False` | `False`  |

#### Example:

```python
x = 5
y = -10
print(x > 0 or y > 0)   # True (First condition is true)
print(x < 0 or y < 0)   # True (Second condition is true)
print(x < 0 or y > 0)   # False (Both conditions are false)
```

---

### **3. `not` Operator**

The `not` operator negates the value of a condition. If the condition is `True`, it returns `False`, and if the condition is `False`, it returns `True`.

#### Syntax:

```python
not A
```

#### Truth Table:

| `A`     | `not A` |
| ------- | ------- |
| `True`  | `False` |
| `False` | `True`  |

#### Example:

```python
x = 5
print(not (x > 0))  # False (x > 0 is True, so not True is False)
print(not (x < 0))  # True (x < 0 is False, so not False is True)
```

---

## **Advanced Use Cases**

### **1. Combining Logical Operators**

Logical operators can be combined for complex conditions. Parentheses can be used to group conditions and control the order of evaluation.

#### Example:

```python
x = 5
y = 10
z = -3
print((x > 0 and y > 0) or z > 0)  # True
```

### **2. Short-Circuiting**

- **`and`**: Stops evaluation if the first condition is `False`, because the result will always be `False`.
- **`or`**: Stops evaluation if the first condition is `True`, because the result will always be `True`.

#### Example:

```python
# `and` short-circuiting
print(False and (1 / 0))  # Does not raise an error because the first condition is False.

# `or` short-circuiting
print(True or (1 / 0))    # Does not raise an error because the first condition is True.
```

### **3. Logical Operators with Non-Boolean Values**

In Python, logical operators can also work with non-boolean values. The result depends on the **truthy** or **falsy** nature of the values.

- **Truthy values**: Non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, non-empty lists, etc.
- **Falsy values**: `0`, `None`, `''`, `[]`, etc.

#### Examples:

```python
print(5 and 10)        # 10 (Returns the last truthy value)
print(0 and 10)        # 0 (Returns the first falsy value)
print(5 or 10)         # 5 (Returns the first truthy value)
print(0 or 10)         # 10 (Returns the first truthy value)
```

---

## **Operator Precedence**

When multiple logical operators are used in an expression, their precedence determines the order of evaluation:

1. `not` (Highest precedence)
2. `and`
3. `or` (Lowest precedence)

#### Example:

```python
x = True
y = False
z = True
print(not x or y and z)  # False (Equivalent to: (not x) or (y and z))
```

---

## **Practical Examples**

### **1. Checking Multiple Conditions**

```python
age = 25
income = 30000
if age > 18 and income > 25000:
    print("Eligible for loan")
else:
    print("Not eligible")
```

### **2. Default Values with `or`**

```python
name = ""
print(name or "Guest")  # Output: Guest (If `name` is empty, use default value)
```

### **3. Input Validation**

```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if not (number % 2 == 0 or number % 5 == 0):
    print("The number is not divisible by 2 or 5")
else:
    print("The number is divisible by 2 or 5")
```

---

## **Common Mistakes**

1. **Not Understanding Short-Circuiting**:

   - Avoid assuming all conditions are evaluated.

   ```python
   print(True or (1 / 0))  # Works because the second condition is not evaluated.
   ```

2. **Improper Use of Parentheses**:
   - Parentheses help to clarify the grouping of conditions.
   ```python
   print(not True or False and True)  # Result: False (Precedence is tricky)
   print(not (True or False) and True)  # Result: False
   ```

This overview of Python's logical operators covers basic and advanced usage, practical examples, and potential pitfalls. Let me know if you need further clarification!

In Python, **logical operator precedence** determines the order in which logical operations are evaluated when multiple logical operators (`not`, `and`, `or`) appear in the same expression. Knowing precedence ensures that you write expressions that behave as intended.

---

## **Logical Operator Precedence**

The precedence of logical operators is as follows:

1. **`not`**: Highest precedence
2. **`and`**: Medium precedence
3. **`or`**: Lowest precedence

This means:

- **`not`** is evaluated first.
- **`and`** is evaluated next.
- **`or`** is evaluated last.

---

### **Syntax and Examples**

#### 1. **`not` Precedence**

The `not` operator negates the condition it applies to and is evaluated first.

```python
# Example 1
x = True
print(not x and False)  # False (Equivalent to: (not x) and False)

# Example 2
y = False
print(not y or True)    # True (Equivalent to: (not y) or True)
```

#### 2. **`and` Precedence**

The `and` operator is evaluated after `not` but before `or`.

```python
# Example 1
x = True
y = False
print(x and y or True)  # True (Equivalent to: (x and y) or True)

# Example 2
print(not x and y)      # False (Equivalent to: (not x) and y)
```

#### 3. **`or` Precedence**

The `or` operator has the lowest precedence and is evaluated last.

```python
# Example 1
x = True
y = False
z = True
print(x or y and z)     # True (Equivalent to: x or (y and z))

# Example 2
print(not x or y and z) # False (Equivalent to: (not x) or (y and z))
```

---

### **Precedence Summary with Examples**

| Operator | Precedence | Description                                                                | Example                   | Result  |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------- |
| `not`    | High       | Evaluates first; negates the boolean value of the condition it applies to. | `not True and False`      | `False` |
| `and`    | Medium     | Evaluates next; returns `True` if both conditions are true.                | `True and False or True`  | `True`  |
| `or`     | Low        | Evaluates last; returns `True` if at least one condition is true.          | `False or True and False` | `False` |

---

### **Using Parentheses to Control Evaluation**

When expressions become complex, parentheses can be used to override the default precedence.

#### Example:

```python
x = True
y = False
z = True

# Without parentheses
result = not x or y and z
print(result)  # False (Equivalent to: (not x) or (y and z))

# With parentheses
result = not (x or y) and z
print(result)  # False (Equivalent to: not ((x or y) and z))
```

### **Combining Logical and Comparison Operators**

Logical operators (`not`, `and`, `or`) often combine comparison expressions (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`).

#### Example:

```python
x = 10
y = 20
z = 5

# Without parentheses (default precedence)
print(x > z and y < 50 or z == 5)  # True (Equivalent to: ((x > z) and (y < 50)) or (z == 5))

# With parentheses (explicit grouping)
print(x > z and (y < 50 or z == 5))  # True
```

---

### **Common Mistakes**

1. **Misinterpreting Precedence**:
   Incorrect assumptions about evaluation order can lead to bugs.

   ```python
   x = True
   y = False
   z = True
   print(x or y and not z)  # False (Expected: True)
   ```

   **Explanation**:

   - `not z` is evaluated first (`not True` → `False`).
   - `y and not z` is next (`False and False` → `False`).
   - `x or (y and not z)` is last (`True or False` → `True`).

2. **Forgetting Parentheses in Complex Expressions**:
   Always use parentheses when multiple operators are combined for better readability and accuracy.
   ```python
   x = True
   y = False
   z = True
   print((x or y) and (not z))  # Explicitly groups the operations.
   ```

---

### **Short-Circuiting and Precedence**

Logical operators use **short-circuit evaluation**:

- **`and`**: Stops evaluating if the first condition is `False`.
- **`or`**: Stops evaluating if the first condition is `True`.

This behavior respects precedence but can further optimize evaluations.

#### Example:

```python
# Short-circuit with `and`
print(False and (1 / 0))  # Does not raise an error because `False` stops further evaluation.

# Short-circuit with `or`
print(True or (1 / 0))    # Does not raise an error because `True` stops further evaluation.
```

---

### **Truth Table Summary**

#### Combined Truth Table for `not`, `and`, `or`:

| `A`     | `B`     | `not A` | `A and B` | `A or B` |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- | -------- |
| `True`  | `True`  | `False` | `True`    | `True`   |
| `True`  | `False` | `False` | `False`   | `True`   |
| `False` | `True`  | `True`  | `False`   | `True`   |
| `False` | `False` | `True`  | `False`   | `False`  |

---

### **Tips for Writing Clear Logical Expressions**

1. **Prefer Explicit Grouping**:
   Use parentheses even when they aren't strictly necessary for clarity.

   ```python
   if (x > 0 and y > 0) or (z < 0):
       print("Condition is True")
   ```

2. **Combine with Comparison Operators**:
   Logical operators are often used with comparison operators to form compound conditions.

   ```python
   if x > 0 and y > 0:
       print("Both x and y are positive")
   ```

3. **Use Short-Circuiting to Your Advantage**:
   Write conditions to prevent unnecessary calculations or errors.
   ```python
   if data and len(data) > 0:  # Avoids error if `data` is None
       print("Data is non-empty")
   ```

### **Logical Operators and Short-Circuiting in Python: A Comprehensive Guide**

Python's logical operators (`and`, `or`, and `not`) exhibit **short-circuit evaluation**, meaning they evaluate only as much of an expression as needed to determine the result. This can optimize performance and prevent unnecessary computations or errors.

---

## **Logical Operators Overview**

### **`and`**

- Evaluates to `True` if **both** conditions are `True`.
- Short-circuits (stops evaluating) if the first condition is `False`.

#### Syntax:

```python
# Basic syntax
result = condition1 and condition2

# Example
x = 10
print(x > 5 and x < 20)  # True (both conditions are True)
```

#### Short-Circuiting Behavior:

- Stops evaluation as soon as it encounters a `False`.

```python
# Example
print(False and (1 / 0))  # Short-circuits, no error raised
```

---

### **`or`**

- Evaluates to `True` if **at least one** condition is `True`.
- Short-circuits if the first condition is `True`.

#### Syntax:

```python
# Basic syntax
result = condition1 or condition2

# Example
x = 10
print(x < 5 or x > 0)  # True (second condition is True)
```

#### Short-Circuiting Behavior:

- Stops evaluation as soon as it encounters a `True`.

```python
# Example
print(True or (1 / 0))  # Short-circuits, no error raised
```

---

### **`not`**

- Evaluates the negation of a condition.
- Does not short-circuit as it applies to a single condition.

#### Syntax:

```python
# Basic syntax
result = not condition

# Example
x = 10
print(not (x > 5))  # False (negates True)
```

---

## **Short-Circuiting Behavior in Depth**

### 1. **With `and`**

```python
# If the first condition is False, the second condition is not evaluated.
print(False and print("This won't run"))  # Prints nothing

# Both conditions are evaluated only if the first is True.
print(True and print("This will run"))  # Prints: "This will run"
```

### 2. **With `or`**

```python
# If the first condition is True, the second condition is not evaluated.
print(True or print("This won't run"))  # Prints nothing

# Both conditions are evaluated only if the first is False.
print(False or print("This will run"))  # Prints: "This will run"
```

---

## **Examples of Short-Circuiting**

### Avoiding Errors

Short-circuiting can prevent errors by skipping unsafe operations.

```python
# Safe evaluation with short-circuiting
data = None
print(data and data[0])  # None (Does not raise an error because `data` is None)
```

### Lazy Evaluation

Short-circuiting helps avoid expensive computations if the result is already determined.

```python
# Example
def expensive_computation():
    print("Computing...")
    return True

print(True or expensive_computation())  # True (Does not call `expensive_computation`)
```

---

## **Common Patterns with Short-Circuiting**

### Checking for Non-Empty Variables

```python
data = []
print(data and len(data) > 0)  # Evaluates to [] (short-circuits if data is empty)
```

### Setting Default Values

```python
value = None
result = value or "Default"
print(result)  # "Default" (short-circuits if `value` is None or False-like)
```

### Conditional Chaining

```python
x = 10
y = 20
z = 30
print(x > 0 and y > 0 and z > 0)  # True (all conditions are evaluated sequentially)
```

---

## **Operator Precedence with Short-Circuiting**

| Operator | Precedence | Short-Circuit Behavior                                     |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `not`    | Highest    | Applies only to its operand, no short-circuiting involved. |
| `and`    | Medium     | Stops at first `False`.                                    |
| `or`     | Lowest     | Stops at first `True`.                                     |

---

## **Short-Circuiting with Combined Logical and Comparison Operators**

Logical operators often combine with comparison operators like `<`, `>`, `==`, etc. Short-circuiting still applies.

#### Example:

```python
x = 10
y = 0

# Safe division using short-circuiting
print(y != 0 and (x / y > 1))  # False (short-circuits, no division by zero)

# Checking multiple conditions
print(x > 5 or y < 0)  # True (short-circuits after `x > 5`)
```

---

## **Nested Logical Operations**

Short-circuiting still applies in nested logical expressions.

#### Example:

```python
x = 10
y = 20
z = 0

# Short-circuiting within nested expressions
print((x > 5 and y > 15) or (z != 0 and (x / z > 2)))
# True (short-circuits before evaluating `(z != 0)` due to `(x > 5 and y > 15)`)
```

---

## **Advanced Usage with Generators**

Short-circuiting works seamlessly with generators or iterable evaluations.

#### Example:

```python
# Generator expression
gen = (x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0)

# Short-circuits after finding the first even number
print(any(x > 4 for x in gen))  # True (stops after evaluating `x == 6`)
```

---

### **Summary of Short-Circuiting Behavior**

| Operator | Example           | Stops Evaluation When |
| -------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| `and`    | `cond1 and cond2` | `cond1` is `False`    |
| `or`     | `cond1 or cond2`  | `cond1` is `True`     |
| `not`    | `not cond`        | No short-circuiting   |

This comprehensive overview of logical operators and short-circuiting in Python covers all syntax, behavior, and use cases. Let me know if you'd like further clarifications!

### **Deep Dive into Short-Circuiting in Python**

**Short-circuiting** is a behavior of logical operators (`and`, `or`) where evaluation stops as soon as the result of the expression is determined. This behavior can optimize performance and prevent unnecessary or unsafe operations.

---

## **What is Short-Circuiting?**

Short-circuiting occurs when:

- **`and`**: Stops evaluating further if the first condition is `False` (since the overall result cannot be `True`).
- **`or`**: Stops evaluating further if the first condition is `True` (since the overall result cannot be `False`).

---

## **How Short-Circuiting Works**

### **Logical Operators and Their Behavior**

1. **`and`**

   - Returns the first `False` operand, or the last operand if all are `True`.
   - Stops evaluating when it finds a `False`.

   ```python
   result = False and print("This won't execute")
   print(result)  # False
   ```

2. **`or`**

   - Returns the first `True` operand, or the last operand if all are `False`.
   - Stops evaluating when it finds a `True`.

   ```python
   result = True or print("This won't execute")
   print(result)  # True
   ```

3. **`not`**

   - Does not short-circuit because it applies to a single operand.
   - Simply negates the value of its operand.

   ```python
   result = not True
   print(result)  # False
   ```

---

## **Why Short-Circuiting Matters**

### **1. Avoid Unnecessary Computations**

Short-circuiting skips evaluating conditions that are irrelevant to the final result.

#### Example:

```python
def expensive_function():
    print("Expensive function executed!")
    return True

# The expensive function will not be called.
result = True or expensive_function()
print(result)  # True
```

### **2. Prevent Errors**

Short-circuiting can prevent execution of unsafe operations that would raise exceptions.

#### Example:

```python
x = None

# Without short-circuiting, this would raise an AttributeError.
result = x and x.some_method()
print(result)  # None
```

### **3. Improve Readability**

Short-circuiting simplifies conditions by reducing the need for explicit checks.

#### Example:

```python
# Safe check for non-empty data
data = []
if data and data[0] == "test":
    print("First element is 'test'")
```

---

## **Examples of Short-Circuiting**

### **Simple Conditions**

```python
a = False
b = True

# 'b' is never evaluated because 'a' is False
result = a and b
print(result)  # False
```

### **Complex Conditions**

```python
a = 5
b = 10

# Short-circuits after evaluating `a < 10`
result = a < 10 or b / 0 > 1
print(result)  # True (no ZeroDivisionError)
```

### **Inline Expressions**

Short-circuiting works inline, even when combined with other operations.

```python
x = 0
result = x != 0 and (10 / x) > 1  # Does not raise ZeroDivisionError
print(result)  # False
```

---

## **Short-Circuiting with Generators**

Generators naturally support short-circuiting when combined with logical operations or functions like `any` and `all`.

### **Example with `any`**

```python
gen = (x for x in range(10) if x > 5)

# Stops iteration once a `True` is found
result = any(x > 7 for x in gen)
print(result)  # True
```

### **Example with `all`**

```python
gen = (x for x in range(10) if x > 5)

# Stops iteration once a `False` is found
result = all(x > 7 for x in gen)
print(result)  # False
```

---

## **Short-Circuiting in Conditional Expressions**

Short-circuiting can be combined with conditional expressions (`if-else`) for compact logic.

### **Example**

```python
x = 5

# Safely checks for zero division
result = x != 0 and 10 / x > 1 or "Invalid operation"
print(result)  # True
```

---

## **Operator Precedence and Short-Circuiting**

### **Precedence of Logical Operators**

| **Operator** | **Precedence** |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| `not`        | Highest        |
| `and`        | Medium         |
| `or`         | Lowest         |

Short-circuiting respects precedence:

```python
result = not False or False and True
# Equivalent to: (not False) or (False and True)
print(result)  # True
```

---

## **Performance Implications**

Short-circuiting can reduce runtime by skipping unnecessary evaluations.

### **Example with Functions**

```python
def is_fast():
    print("Fast condition evaluated")
    return True

def is_slow():
    print("Slow condition evaluated")
    return False

# Only `is_fast()` is evaluated
result = is_fast() or is_slow()
print(result)
```

**Output:**

```
Fast condition evaluated
True
```

## **Best Practices for Short-Circuiting**

1. **Use to Avoid Errors**:
   Ensure expressions don't evaluate unsafe operations (e.g., division by zero, accessing attributes of `None`).

2. **Combine with Default Values**:
   Use short-circuiting to set defaults in compact expressions:

   ```python
   name = user_input or "Default Name"
   ```

3. **Minimize Side Effects**:
   Avoid short-circuiting in expressions with unintended side effects:

   ```python
   # Avoid this
   result = func1() or func2()
   # func2() might have important side effects, but it may not be called.
   ```

4. **Explicit Parentheses for Clarity**:
   Use parentheses in complex expressions to improve readability:
   ```python
   result = (x > 5 and y < 10) or (z == 0)
   ```
