  ```bash
  netstat -t
  ```

  Displays only active TCP connections.

- **UDP Connections:**

  ```bash
  netstat -u
  ```

  Displays only active UDP connections.

- **All Connections (TCP and UDP):**
  ```bash
  netstat -a
  ```
  Displays all active connections (both TCP and UDP), including listening and non-listening sockets.

#### **2. Display Listening Ports**

To show only listening ports (ports where a server is waiting for incoming connections):

- **TCP Listening Ports:**

  ```bash
  netstat -lt
  ```

- **UDP Listening Ports:**

  ```bash
  netstat -lu
  ```

- **All Listening Ports:**
  ```bash
  netstat -l
  ```
  This shows both TCP and UDP listening ports.

#### **3. Show Process Identifiers (PID)**

To show the PID associated with each connection:

```bash
netstat -p
```

This option is useful for identifying which processes are using specific network ports.

#### **4. Display Network Interface Statistics**

To display statistics for all network interfaces (e.g., bytes transmitted, packets received):

```bash
netstat -i
```

You can specify a particular interface as well:

```bash
netstat -i eth0
```

Where `eth0` is the name of the network interface.

`netstat` (short for **network statistics**) is a powerful networking tool used to display network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, and various network protocol information. It is useful for troubleshooting network issues, monitoring network activity, and securing systems by showing active connections and listening ports.

Although `netstat` has been largely replaced by newer tools like `ss` on many systems, it remains a standard tool for many network administrators and users. Below is a comprehensive guide to `netstat` commands and options:

### **Basic Syntax**

```bash
netstat [options]
```

### **Common `netstat` Commands and Options**

#### **1. Display All Connections and Listening Ports (`-a`)**

The `-a` option shows all network connections and listening ports (both TCP and UDP):

```bash
netstat -a
```

- **Active connections**: Displays both incoming and outgoing network connections.
- **Listening ports**: Shows ports that are waiting for incoming connections.

#### **2. Display Listening Ports (`-l`)**

To show only ports that are currently listening for incoming connections:

```bash
netstat -l
```

This filters out active connections and only shows the ports that are in the **LISTEN** state.

#### **3. Display Specific Protocols (TCP, UDP)**

- **TCP Connections:**

  ```bash
  netstat -t
  ```

  This filters out only TCP connections.

- **UDP Connections:**
  ```bash
  netstat -u
  ```
  This shows only UDP connections.

#### **4. Display Network Interfaces (`-i`)**

To display statistics for network interfaces:

```bash
netstat -i
```

This shows information such as the number of packets transmitted and received, errors, and collisions.

#### **5. Display Routing Table (`-r`)**

To display the current routing table:

```bash
netstat -r
```

This is similar to running the `route` command and displays the network routes, gateways, and interfaces.

#### **6. Display Network Statistics (`-s`)**

To show network statistics, broken down by protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.):

```bash

netstat -ie
```

#### **17. Show Connection Statistics for Each Protocol (`-s` + `-p`)**

You can combine the `-s` and `-p` options to view protocol-specific statistics:

```bash
netstat -sp tcp
```

This will show statistics specific to TCP, such as retransmits, timeouts, etc.

#### **18. Show Connections to a Specific Host (`-a` + `grep`)**

To view all connections to a specific host or IP:

```bash
netstat -an | grep 192.168.1.100
```

#### **19. Display the Routing Table with Destination and Gateway Information (`-r` + `-n`)**

To display the routing table with IP addresses (without resolving domain names):

```bash
netstat -rn
```

---

### **Examples of Common Use Cases**

#### **1. List All Active TCP Connections**

```bash
netstat -tn
```

This lists all active TCP connections, showing the local and remote IP addresses, ports, and connection states (e.g., `ESTABLISHED`, `TIME_WAIT`).

#### **2. Show Listening Ports and the Program Using Them**

```bash
sudo netstat -tulnp
```

This will show all listening ports, the protocol used (TCP or UDP), the program using each port, and the PID.

#### **3. Monitor Network Activity Continuously**

```bash
netstat -c
```

This command continuously updates the display of network connections.

#### **4. View the Routing Table**

```bash
netstat -r
```

This will show the routing table, which includes information about the destination, gateway, and network interfaces.

#### **5. Find Connections on a Specific Port**

```bash
netstat -an | grep :22
```

This filters the connections and shows only those using port 22 (SSH).

#### **6. View Network Interface Statistics**

```bash
netstat -i
```

This displays the network interface statistics, such as the number of packets received and sent, errors, and collisions.

Sure! Let's dive deeper into `netstat` and its advanced options, along with explanations of how each one works and examples for specific use cases.

### **Detailed Breakdown of `netstat` Options**

#### **1. `-t` (TCP)**

This option filters the output to only show TCP connections.

- **Example:**
  ```bash
  netstat -t
  ```
  This will display all active TCP connections on the system, including both client-side and server-side connections.

#### **2. `-u` (UDP)**

This option filters the output to only show UDP connections.

- **Example:**
  ```bash
  netstat -u
  ```
  Displays all UDP connections, which are connectionless and don't maintain a steady state like TCP connections.

#### **3. `-l` (Listening Sockets)**

This option shows only listening sockets (the ports that are open and waiting for incoming connections).

- **Example:**
  ```bash
  netstat -l
  ```
  This will show all ports where applications are listening for incoming connections. Itâ€™s useful for seeing what services are actively waiting for client connections.

#### **4. `-n` (Numeric Addresses)**

This option displays network addresses and port numbers in numeric format instead of resolving them to hostnames or service names. This speeds up the command execution because it avoids DNS lookups.

- **Example:**
  ```bash
  netstat -n
  ```
  This will show numerical IP addresses and port numbers instead of resolving them to domain names and service names like "HTTP" for port 80 or "ssh" for port 22.

#### **5. `-a` (All Connections and Listening Ports)**

This option displays all connections, including both active and listening ports. It also shows the full details of connections in all states (e.g., LISTENING, ESTABLISHED, TIME_WAIT).

- **Example:**
  ```bash
  netstat -a
  ```
  This will show all TCP and UDP connections and listening ports.

#### **6. `-p` (Show PID and Program Name)**

This option shows the Process ID (PID) and the program name that is associated with each connection. This is useful for identifying which program or service is using a specific network connection or port.

- **Example:**

  ```bash
  netstat -tulnp
  ```

  Here:

  - `-t`: Show TCP connections.
  - `-u`: Show UDP connections.
  - `-l`: Show only listening sockets.
  - `-n`: Display addresses in numeric format.
  - `-p`: Show the PID and program name.

  **Result:** You will get a list of open ports and which applications are using them, like:

  ```
  Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name
  tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1257/sshd
  tcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN      1245/nginx
  ```

#### **7. `-r` (Routing Table)**

This option displays the systemâ€™s routing table, showing how the system routes packets between networks. It provides insight into network paths, gateways, and routing metrics.

- **Example:**
  ```bash
  netstat -r
  ```
  This will show the routing table, including the default gateway and routes for different network interfaces.

#### **8. `-i` (Interface Statistics)**

This option provides detailed statistics about the systemâ€™s network interfaces, such as the number of packets sent/received, errors, dropped packets, etc.

- **Example:**
  ```bash
  netstat -i
  ```
  The output will list all network interfaces (e.g., `eth0`, `lo`, `wlan0`) with their respective packet statistics, including:
  ```
  Kernel Interface table
  Iface    MTU   RX-OK  RX-ERR  RX-DROP  TX-OK  TX-ERR  TX-DROP  Coll
  lo      65536  100000      0       0   100000      0       0     0
  eth0    1500   50000      2       0   45000      0       0     0
  wlan0   1500   40000      3       1   35000      0       0     0
  ```

#### **9. `-s` (Protocol Statistics)**

This option displays statistics for all network protocols in the system, such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.

- **Example:**

  ```bash
  netstat -s
  ```

  This shows protocol-level statistics, like how many packets were sent/received and the number of errors for each protocol.

  **Example Output:**

  ```
  IcmpMsg:
      InType3: 15
      InType8: 20
  IcmpMsg errors: 5
  Udp:
      InDatagrams: 1000
      OutDatagrams: 200
  ```

#### **10. `-g` (Multicast Group Information)**

This option displays the multicast group memberships for your system.

- **Example:**

  ```bash
  netstat -g
  ```

  It shows the multicast group addresses and the interfaces they belong to, which is useful for debugging multicast traffic.

  **Example Output:**

  ```
  IPv4 Multicast Group Memberships
  Interface      Group Address      RefCnt   PIM-SM   Last Reporter
  eth0           233.0.0.1         1        Yes      192.168.0.1
  wlan0          233.0.0.2         1        No       192.168.0.2
  ```

#### **11. `-c` (Continuous Output)**

This option makes `netstat` continuously update the output, which is helpful for monitoring live network activity.

- **Example:**
  ```bash
  netstat -c
  ```
  This will continuously print the current network statistics and connections, updating every second until you stop it (press `Ctrl+C` to exit).

#### **12. `-A` (Address Family)**

This option allows you to specify the address family for the network connections. The valid address families are `inet` (IPv4), `inet6` (IPv6), `unix` (for Unix domain sockets), etc.

- **Example:**
  ```bash
  netstat -A inet
  ```
  This will show only IPv4 connections.

#### **13. `-o` (Show Timer Information)**

This option shows timer-related information for the network connections. This is often used to view the timers for TCP connections, such as the time the connection has been in a certain state (like TIME_WAIT).

- **Example:**
  ```bash
  netstat -o
  ```

### **Practical Use Cases of `netstat`**

#### **1. Troubleshooting Network Connections**

You can use `netstat` to view active network connections and check if a particular port is open and being used by a service:

```bash
netstat -tuln
```

If you are troubleshooting a web server, you may want to confirm that port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) is open:

```bash
netstat -tuln | grep ':80'
```

#### **2. Monitor Open Ports and Listening Services**

For system administrators, monitoring open ports and ensuring that no unauthorized services are running on the system is crucial. To list all listening services (including their program names):

```bash
netstat -tulnp
```

#### **3. Check the Routing Table**

If you're having trouble with network connectivity, you can use `netstat -r` to verify your routing table and ensure that the correct routes are in place. For example, you can check if the default gateway is set properly for external internet access:

```bash
netstat -r
```

#### **4. Analyze Network Traffic on Interfaces**

If your server is experiencing network congestion or slowdowns, you can use `netstat -i` to check the statistics for each interface:

```bash
netstat -i
```

It will help you identify if there are dropped packets or errors on any particular interface.

#### **5. Identify the Process Using a Port**

If you suspect that a specific process or application is using an unusual port, you can find the program by listing the PID with:

```bash
netstat -tulnp
```

This will show which processes are using which ports.

### **Difference Between `netstat` and `ss`**

`netstat` is an older tool, and on modern Linux systems, `ss` is becoming the preferred tool due to its faster execution and better performance. Hereâ€™s how you can use `ss` for similar output:

- **List TCP connections:**

  ```bash
  ss -t
  ```

- **List all connections:**

  ```bash
  ss -a
  ```

- **Display listening ports:**
  ```bash
  ss -l
  ```

`ss` provides detailed information, including socket states and process information, in a more efficient manner.

### **Conclusion**

`netstat` is an essential tool for network diagnostics, monitoring, and troubleshooting. The command is highly configurable, and you can use various options to focus on specific aspects of the systemâ€™s network behavior. Whether youâ€™re interested in active connections, listening ports, routing tables, or network statistics, `netstat` provides the necessary insights. However, keep in mind that on modern systems, `ss` might be a faster and more efficient alternative for some tasks.
