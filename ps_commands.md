The `ps` command in Linux is used to display information about currently running processes on the system. It is one of the most essential tools for monitoring and managing processes in Unix-like operating systems. Here’s an in-depth guide to everything about the `ps` command.

---

## **What is `ps`?**

`ps` stands for **Process Status**. It provides details such as:

- Process ID (PID)
- Parent Process ID (PPID)
- User owning the process
- CPU and memory usage
- Command that started the process

---

## **Basic Syntax**

```bash
ps [options]
```

When run without options, `ps` displays the processes associated with the current terminal session.

### Example:

```bash
ps
```

#### Output:

```
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 1234 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
 2345 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```

- **PID**: Process ID.
- **TTY**: Terminal associated with the process.
- **TIME**: CPU time used by the process.
- **CMD**: Command used to start the process.

---

## **Key Options**

Here’s a breakdown of the most commonly used `ps` options:

| Option         | Description                                                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-e` or `-A`   | Displays all processes on the system.                                   |
| `-f`           | Full-format listing, including PPID, start time, etc.                   |
| `-u [user]`    | Displays processes for a specific user.                                 |
| `-x`           | Shows processes without controlling terminals (background processes).   |
| `-o [format]`  | Allows custom output format (e.g., PID, CMD, %CPU, %MEM).               |
| `aux`          | Shows all processes with detailed information (commonly used together). |
| `--sort=[key]` | Sorts output by a specific field (e.g., `%cpu`, `%mem`, `pid`).         |
| `--forest`     | Displays processes in a tree-like hierarchy.                            |
| `-p [pid]`     | Displays information about specific process IDs.                        |

```bash
ps -e --forest
```

---

### **8. Monitor Daemons or Background Processes**

```bash
ps -x
```

This shows processes without an associated terminal (e.g., daemons, background jobs).

---

### **9. Combine Options**

You can combine multiple options to refine output:

```bash
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head
```

This lists the top processes consuming the most CPU.

---

### **10. View Threads of a Process**

To view threads of a specific process:

```bash
ps -T -p <pid>
```

---

## **Process States (`STAT` Column)**

The **STAT** column indicates the state of a process:

- **R**: Running
- **S**: Sleeping (idle)
- **D**: Uninterruptible sleep (usually I/O wait)
- **Z**: Zombie (terminated but not cleaned up)
- **T**: Stopped (e.g., via `Ctrl+Z`)
- **I**: Idle (recent kernels)

Additional codes:

- **<**: High-priority process.
- **N**: Low-priority (nice) process.
- **L**: Has pages locked in memory.

---

## **Advanced Features**

### **1. Kill a Process**

You can combine `ps` with `kill` to terminate a process:

1. Find the PID of the process:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep process_name
   ```
2. Kill the process:
   ```bash
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

---

### **2. Script Example: Monitor High CPU Usage**

```bash
while true; do
  ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -n 5
  sleep 5
done
```

This script displays the top 5 processes consuming CPU every 5 seconds.

---

## **Comparison: `ps` vs. `top`**

| Feature     | `ps`                | `top`                          |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Output      | Static snapshot     | Dynamic real-time updates      |
| Interaction | Non-interactive     | Interactive (e.g., kill, sort) |
| Use Case    | One-time monitoring | Continuous monitoring          |

---

## **Helpful Aliases**

To simplify usage, you can set up aliases in your shell configuration (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
alias psa="ps aux --sort=-%cpu"
alias pst="ps -e --forest"
```

The `ps` (process status) command in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems is used to display information about running processes. It provides detailed data on processes, including their process IDs (PIDs), memory usage, CPU usage, and more.

Here's an **in-depth guide** to the `ps` command:

---

## **Basic Syntax**

```bash
ps [options]
```

Where `[options]` specify what information about processes you want to see.

---

## **Common `ps` Options**

### **1. Basic `ps` Usage**

```bash
ps
```

This command shows processes running in the current terminal session. The output typically includes the following columns:

- **PID**: Process ID
- **TTY**: The terminal associated with the process
- **TIME**: Total CPU time used by the process
- **CMD**: The command that started the process

Example output:

  PID TTY          TIME CMD
  123 pts/0    00:00:01 bash
  456 pts/0    00:00:02 ps
```

### **2. Show All Processes (`-e` or `-A`)**

```bash
ps -e
```

or

```bash
ps -A
```

This displays **all processes** running on the system, including processes started by other users or background processes.

Output example:

```
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
    1 ?        00:00:00 systemd
    2 ?        00:00:00 kthreadd
   ...
  456 pts/0    00:00:01 bash
  789 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```

### **3. Show Processes for Current User (`-u`)**

```bash
ps -u
```

This shows the processes running under the **current user**. It displays additional columns, including user name, PID, and the CPU/memory usage for each process.

Example output:

```
  USER       PID  %CPU %MEM     VSZ    RSS   TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
  user1     1234  0.1  0.5   56324   2345 pts/0    Ss+  09:00   0:00 bash
  user1     5678  0.0  0.2   78930   1123 pts/0    S+   09:10   0:00 ps
```

### **4. Show Process Tree (`--forest`)**

```bash
ps --forest
```

This option displays processes in a **tree-like structure**, showing parent-child relationships between processes. It's especially useful for visualizing process hierarchies.

Example output:

```
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
  123 pts/0    00:00:02 bash
  567 pts/0    00:00:00  \_ ps
```

### **5. Show Full Process Information (`-f`)**

```bash
ps -f
```

This provides a **full-format listing** of processes, including more columns like the parent process ID (PPID), user, and start time.

Example output:

```
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
user1     1234  5678  0 09:00 pts/0    00:00:02 bash
user1     5678  1234  0 09:10 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```

### **6. Show Specific User’s Processes (`-u [user]`)**

```bash
ps -u username
```

This displays the processes running for a specific user.

Example output:

```
  USER       PID  %CPU %MEM     VSZ    RSS   TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
  user1     1234  0.1  0.5   56324   2345 pts/0    Ss+  09:00   0:00 bash
```

### **7. Show Process with Additional Memory Usage (`-o` option)**

```bash
ps -eo pid,comm,%mem,%cpu
```

This displays the **PID**, command name, memory usage, and CPU usage of all processes. The `-e` flag lists all processes, while `-o` allows specifying the output format.

Output example:

```
  PID CMD              %MEM %CPU
  123 bash             1.3  0.1
  456 ps               0.1  0.0
```

---

## **Advanced `ps` Options**

### **1. Show Process Information with Specific Format (`-o`)**

You can customize the output to show specific fields using the `-o` option. Here’s an example with multiple fields:

```bash
ps -eo pid,ppid,uid,gid,etime,cmd
```

This shows the **PID**, **PPID** (parent PID), **UID**, **GID**, **elapsed time**, and **command** of all running processes.

### **2. Show Processes with a Specific Name (`-C`)**

```bash
ps -C process_name
```

This will display processes with the specific name you provide. For example:

```bash
ps -C apache2
```

This lists all processes running with the `apache2` name.

### **3. Show Process Details for a Specific PID**

```bash
ps -p PID
```

This shows detailed information for a **specific process** using its PID. For example:

```bash
ps -p 1234
```

### **4. Show Processes Sorted by CPU Usage (`--sort`)**

```bash
ps -eo pid,comm,%cpu --sort=-%cpu
```

This sorts processes by CPU usage, showing the most CPU-intensive processes first.

Output example:

```
  PID CMD              %CPU
  123 bash             10.5
  456 ps               0.0
```

- `-` before `%cpu` sorts in **descending** order (from highest to lowest).

### **5. Show Processes in Real Time (`top` Alternative)**

```bash
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10
```

This command displays the **top 10 memory-hogging processes** by sorting them in descending order of memory usage. It uses `ps aux` to get all processes and `head` to display only the top 10.

### **6. Show Process Information with Command Arguments (`-f` for Full Command Line)**

```bash
ps -f -p PID
```

This provides the full command line of the process, including any arguments that were passed to it. The `-f` flag shows the full format, which is especially useful for processes that were started with specific command-line arguments.

### **7. Display Processes by Terminal (`-t`)**

```bash
ps -t tty1
```

This displays processes running on a specific terminal, such as `tty1`.

### **8. Show Threads of a Process (`-L`)**

```bash
ps -L -p PID
```

This shows the **threads** of a specific process. The `-L` flag is used to list all threads (not just processes).

---

## **Example Usage**

### **1. Monitor Processes in Real Time**

To get a snapshot of all processes, including CPU and memory usage:

```bash
ps aux
```

Example output:

```
USER       PID  %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
user1     1234  1.0  2.5  12345 6789 tty1     S+   09:00   0:10 bash
user1     5678  0.2  1.0  23456 3456 tty1     S+   09:05   0:00 ps
```

### **2. Show Process Tree (Parent-Child Relationship)**

```bash
ps --forest
```

This will give a hierarchical view of processes, showing how processes are related to their parents.

### **3. Show All Running Processes with Memory and CPU Usage**

```bash
ps aux --sort=-%cpu
```

This shows all processes sorted by CPU usage in descending order.

### **4. Display the Process Tree for a Specific User**

```bash
ps -U username --forest
```

This displays the process tree for all processes belonging to a specific user, arranged hierarchically.

## **`ps` vs. Other Process Management Commands**

- **`top`**: Provides a dynamic, real-time view of system processes and their resource usage. Unlike `ps`, which is static, `top` is interactive.
- **`htop`**: A more advanced, interactive version of `top`, with a more user-friendly interface.
- **`pgrep`**: This command is useful for searching for processes by name. For example, `pgrep apache2` will return the PID(s) of all `apache2` processes.
- **`kill`**: Used to terminate processes, while `ps` is used to view them.

The `ps` command in Linux displays information about the currently running processes on the system. It is one of the most commonly used commands for monitoring and managing processes.

---

## **What is `ps`?**

- **`ps` (Process Status)** provides information about processes running in the system, including:
  - Process IDs (PIDs)
  - Status of processes (e.g., running, sleeping)
  - CPU and memory usage
  - User associated with the process
  - Command that started the process

By default, the `ps` command displays processes for the current user and terminal.

---

## **Basic Syntax**

```bash
ps [options]
```

---

## **Default Output**

Running `ps` without options:

```bash
ps
```

Example Output:

```
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 1234 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
 5678 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```

### Explanation:

- **PID**: Process ID
- **TTY**: Terminal controlling the process
- **TIME**: CPU time consumed by the process
- **CMD**: Command that initiated the process

---

## **Commonly Used Options**

### 1. **Show All Processes (`-e` or `-A`)**

To list all running processes:

```bash
ps -e
```

or

```bash
ps -A
```

### 2. **Detailed Process Info (`-f` or `--full`)**

For a more detailed view:

```bash
ps -f
```

Example Output:

```
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root         1     0  0 Dec28 ?        00:00:01 init
user      1234     1  0 Dec28 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
```

- **UID**: User ID (who owns the process)
- **PID**: Process ID
- **PPID**: Parent Process ID (which process started it)
- **C**: CPU usage percentage
- **STIME**: Start time of the process
- **TTY**: Terminal associated with the process
- **TIME**: CPU time used by the process
- **CMD**: Command that started the process

### 3. **Processes for a Specific User (`-u`)**

To view processes for a specific user:

```bash
ps -u username
```

Example:

```bash
ps -u root
```

### 4. **Hierarchical View (`--forest`)**

To see processes in a tree structure:

```bash
ps --forest
```

### 5. **View by Parent-Child Relationship (`--ppid`)**

To see processes started by a specific parent:

```bash
ps --ppid <parent_pid>
```

### 6. **Show Process by Name (`-C`)**

To search for a process by name:

```bash
ps -C process_name
```

Example:

```bash
ps -C sshd
```

### 7. **Display Processes with Specific Attributes**

#### Show Processes by PID:

```bash
ps -p <pid>
```

Example:

```bash
ps -p 1234
```

#### Show Processes by Group (`-g`):

```bash
ps -g group_id
```

---

## **Advanced Output Customization**

### 1. **Custom Format (`-o`)**

To display specific fields using the `-o` option:

```bash
ps -o pid,user,%cpu,%mem,cmd
```

Example Output:

```
  PID USER     %CPU %MEM CMD
 1234 root     0.3  1.5 /usr/sbin/sshd
 5678 user     0.1  0.7 bash
```

#### Common Fields:

- **%cpu**: CPU usage
- **%mem**: Memory usage
- **comm**: Command name
- **args**: Full command with arguments
- **start**: Process start time
- **etime**: Elapsed time since the process started
- **tty**: Terminal associated with the process

---

### 2. **Show Top Resource Usage**

To sort by CPU or memory usage:

```bash
ps -eo pid,user,%cpu,%mem,cmd --sort=-%cpu
```

- `-e`: Show all processes
- `-o`: Custom format
- `--sort`: Sort by a field (e.g., `-%cpu` for descending CPU usage)

---

### 3. **Interactive Process Monitoring**

For real-time monitoring, use `top` or `htop`. The `ps` command is static and displays a snapshot.

---

## **Useful Combinations**

### 1. **Find a Process by Name and Kill It**

```bash
ps -C process_name
kill <pid>
```

### 2. **Find All Processes Run by a User**

```bash
ps -u username
```

### 3. **Show Zombie Processes**

Zombie processes have the status `Z`. To find them:

```bash
ps -eo pid,stat,cmd | grep Z
```

### 4. **Monitor a Process Over Time**

You can monitor a process with a `watch` command:

```bash
watch -n 1 'ps -p <pid> -o pid,%cpu,%mem,cmd'
```

---

## **Explanation of Process States (in `STAT`)**

- **R**: Running
- **S**: Sleeping
- **D**: Uninterruptible sleep (usually I/O)
- **T**: Stopped (paused)
- **Z**: Zombie
- **X**: Dead

---

## **Examples**

### Show all processes running on the system:

```bash
ps -e
```

### Display detailed information about all processes:

```bash
ps -ef
```

### View processes sorted by memory usage:

```bash
ps -eo pid,%mem,cmd --sort=-%mem
```

### Find the process consuming the most CPU:

```bash
ps -eo pid,%cpu,cmd --sort=-%cpu | head
```

### List all processes belonging to a user:

```bash
ps -u username
```
