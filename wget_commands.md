The `wget` command is a powerful, command-line utility used for downloading files from the web in Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS, etc.). It supports downloading files via HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, and offers many options to control the download process. Below is a comprehensive guide to `wget`, covering its basic usage, advanced features, and real-world examples.

---

## **1. Basic Syntax**

```
wget [options] [URL]
```

- **[options]**: Modify how `wget` behaves (optional).
- **[URL]**: The URL of the file you want to download.

---

## **2. Basic Commands**

### **A. Download a Single File**

To download a file from a specific URL:

```bash
wget https://example.com/file.zip
```

This will download the file from `https://example.com/file.zip` and save it in the current directory with the same name (`file.zip`).

### **B. Download to a Specific Directory**

To specify the directory where the downloaded file should be saved, use the `-P` option:

```bash
wget -P /path/to/directory https://example.com/file.zip
```

This will download the file to `/path/to/directory`.

### **C. Download with a Different Filename**

You can specify a different filename using the `-O` option:

```bash
wget -O custom_name.zip https://example.com/file.zip
```

This will download the file and save it as `custom_name.zip` in the current directory.

### **D. Download Multiple Files**

You can download multiple files by specifying multiple URLs:

```bash
wget https://example.com/file1.zip https://example.com/file2.zip
```

Alternatively, you can specify a text file containing URLs to download:

```bash
wget -i urls.txt
```

Where `urls.txt` contains a list of URLs, one per line.

---

## **3. Advanced Options**

### **A. Resume an Interrupted Download**

If a download is interrupted (e.g., network failure), you can resume it using the `-c` (continue) option:

```bash
wget -c https://example.com/largefile.iso
```

This will continue the download from where it left off.

### **B. Download Files in the Background**

To download files in the background (without blocking the terminal), use the `-b` option:

```bash
wget -b https://example.com/largefile.iso
```

This will start the download in the background, and the download log will be written to a file named `wget-log` by default.

### **C. Download a Website or Mirror a Site**

`wget` can download entire websites (including all files linked to the website) for offline viewing. Use the `-r` (recursive) and `-l` (level) options to download a website:

```bash
wget -r -l 5 https://example.com
```

Explanation:

- `-r`: Download the website recursively.
- `-l 5`: Limit recursion to 5 levels.

To mirror an entire website, use the `--mirror` option, which is equivalent to `-r -N -l inf --no-remove-listing`:

```bash
wget --mirror https://example.com
```

This will download the website, including all linked files, and mirror it for offline browsing.

### **D. Limit Download Speed**

You can limit the download speed using the `--limit-rate` option:

```bash
wget --limit-rate=100k https://example.com/largefile.iso
```

This will limit the download speed to 100 KB/s.

### **E. Download Files with Authentication**

If a website requires authentication (e.g., a username and password), use the `--user` and `--password` options:

```bash
wget --user=username --password=password https://example.com/protectedfile.zip
```

Alternatively, you can prompt for the password interactively:

```bash
wget --user=username --ask-password https://example.com/protectedfile.zip
```

### **F. Download with Cookies**

If the website uses cookies for authentication or tracking, you can specify cookies using the `--load-cookies` option:

```bash
wget --load-cookies cookies.txt https://example.com/securefile.zip
```

Where `cookies.txt` is a file containing cookies.

### **G. Download All Files Matching a Pattern**

To download all files matching a pattern (e.g., all `.jpg` images from a webpage), use the `-A` (accept) option:

```bash
wget -r -A "*.jpg" https://example.com/gallery/
```

This will download all `.jpg` files from the `https://example.com/gallery/` directory.

---

## **4. Managing Downloads**

### **A. Limit the Number of Retries**

To limit the number of retries in case of failure, use the `--tries` option:

```bash
wget --tries=3 https://example.com/file.zip
```

This will attempt to download the file a maximum of 3 times before giving up.

### **B. Set Timeout for Downloads**

If you want to set a timeout for connecting to the server or downloading, use the `--timeout` option:

```bash
wget --timeout=30 https://example.com/file.zip
```

This will set the timeout to 30 seconds.

### **C. Show Download Progress**

By default, `wget` shows a progress bar for downloads. If you want to show detailed information about the download, use the `-d` (debug) option:

```bash
wget -d https://example.com/largefile.iso
```

This will display detailed information about the download process, including headers and other debug information.

### **D. Ignore SSL Certificate Errors**

If you're downloading from a site with SSL certificate issues (e.g., expired or self-signed certificates), use the `--no-check-certificate` option:

```bash
wget --no-check-certificate https://example.com/insecurefile.zip
```

This will bypass SSL certificate verification.

---

## **5. Handling Errors and Retries**

### **A. Retry on Failure**

You can make `wget` retry a download if it fails, with a specific delay between retries. Use the `--wait` and `--retry-connrefused` options for this:

```bash
wget --wait=5 --retry-connrefused --tries=10 https://example.com/largefile.iso
```

Explanation:

- `--wait=5`: Wait 5 seconds between retries.
- `--retry-connrefused`: Retry if the connection is refused.
- `--tries=10`: Try downloading the file 10 times.

### **B. Log Errors to a File**

To log errors and output to a file, use the `-o` option:

```bash
wget -o download_log.txt https://example.com/largefile.iso
```

This will log all download activity, including errors, to `download_log.txt`.

---

## **6. Advanced Usage and Automation**

### **A. Download Files Based on Time of Last Modification**

To download only files that have been modified since your last download (based on the timestamp), use the `-N` (timestamping) option:

```bash
wget -N https://example.com/file.zip
```

This ensures that you only download files that are newer than the local file, saving time and bandwidth.

### **B. Download Files Using FTP**

`wget` can also be used for FTP downloads. Here’s an example of downloading a file from an FTP server:

```bash
wget ftp://example.com/file.zip
```

For FTP authentication, use the `--ftp-user` and `--ftp-password` options:

```bash
wget --ftp-user=username --ftp-password=password ftp://example.com/file.zip
```

### **C. Use `wget` in Scripts**

`wget` is often used in shell scripts for automating the download of files. Here’s a simple example script that uses `wget` to download a list of files:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
urls=("https://example.com/file1.zip" "https://example.com/file2.zip")
for url in "${urls[@]}"; do
  wget "$url"
done
```

This script downloads multiple files from an array of URLs.

### **D. Download Files in Parallel (Using `xargs`)**

To download multiple files concurrently (in parallel), you can use `xargs`:

```bash
cat urls.txt | xargs -n 1 -P 4 wget
```

Explanation:

- `-n 1`: Process one URL at a time.
- `-P 4`: Download 4 files in parallel.

### **Conclusion**

`wget` is an extremely versatile and reliable tool for downloading files over HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP. It provides robust features such as background downloads, resuming interrupted downloads, and mirroring websites. By combining various options, you can tailor `wget` to fit a variety of use cases, from simple file downloads to complex batch downloads or website mirroring.

Let me know if you need more specific examples or further clarification on any of the options!

The `wget` command is a powerful utility in Linux and Unix-based systems that is used for downloading files from the web. It stands for "World Wide Web Get" and is typically used for non-interactive downloading, meaning it can run in the background and doesn’t require user input once it’s initiated.

Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of various `wget` command usages:

### 1. **Basic Download**

To download a file:

```
wget http://example.com/file.txt
```

This command downloads the file `file.txt` from the given URL to the current directory.

### 2. **Download to a Specific Directory**

To specify the directory to save the downloaded file:

```
wget -P /path/to/directory http://example.com/file.txt
```

This command downloads the file to the directory `/path/to/directory`.

### 3. **Download a File with a Different Name**

You can rename the file while downloading it:

```
wget -O newname.txt http://example.com/file.txt
```

### 4. **Resuming an Interrupted Download**

If a download is interrupted, you can resume it using the `-c` option:

```
wget -c http://example.com/largefile.iso
```

### 5. **Download Multiple Files**

You can download multiple files by specifying URLs or using a text file with a list of URLs:

```
wget -i urls.txt
```

Where `urls.txt` contains a list of URLs (one per line).

### 6. **Download All Files from a Website (Recursive Download)**

To download an entire website or parts of it (use with caution due to the large data load), use the recursive option:

```
wget -r http://example.com/
```

To limit the depth of the recursion:

```
wget -r -l 2 http://example.com/
```

`-l` limits the depth (e.g., 2 means follow links two levels deep).

### 7. **Download in Background**

To download a file in the background:

```
wget -b http://example.com/file.txt
```

You can check the progress in a log file (usually `wget-log`).

### 8. **Limit Download Speed**

To limit the download speed:

```
wget --limit-rate=200k http://example.com/file.txt
```

This limits the download speed to 200 KB/s.

### 9. **User-Agent String**

Some websites block default user agents, so you can change the `User-Agent` string:

```
wget --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0" http://example.com/file.txt
```

### 10. **Download Over HTTPS**

`wget` supports secure downloads using HTTPS:

```
wget https://example.com/file.txt
```

### 11. **Mirror a Website (Full Download of a Website)**

To mirror a website, use the following options:

```
wget -m -p -E -k -K -np http://example.com/
```

Here’s what each option does:

- `-m` (mirror) makes `wget` download recursively, set up a timestamping, and download everything necessary for offline browsing.
- `-p` (page requisites) downloads all files needed to display the page (e.g., images, CSS).
- `-E` (adjust extensions) ensures that HTML files are saved with the `.html` extension.
- `-k` (convert links) converts the links for offline viewing.
- `-K` (backup) saves the original files as `.orig`.
- `-np` (no-parent) ensures `wget` doesn't ascend to parent directories when downloading.

### 12. **Download Files via FTP**

If you’re downloading files from an FTP server:

```
wget ftp://ftp.example.com/file.txt
```

### 13. **Authentication for Private Resources**

If the resource requires authentication, you can use the `--user` and `--password` options:

```
wget --user=username --password=password http://example.com/privatefile.txt
```

### 14. **Skip SSL Certificate Validation**

If the server has an invalid SSL certificate (not recommended for security reasons), you can skip certificate verification:

```
wget --no-check-certificate https://example.com/file.txt
```

### 15. **Download a Specific Range of a File**

If you only want to download part of a file (such as a specific range of bytes):

```
wget --header="Range: bytes=0-1023" http://example.com/file.txt
```

### 16. **Check if File Exists Without Downloading**

To check if a file exists on the server without downloading it:

```
wget --spider http://example.com/file.txt
```

This will output information about the file without downloading it.

### 17. **Limit the Number of Retries**

To set a maximum number of retries in case of network failure:

```
wget --tries=3 http://example.com/file.txt
```

### 18. **HTTP Headers**

To display the headers returned by the server, you can use the `-S` option:

```
wget -S http://example.com/file.txt
```

### 19. **Verbose Output**

To get detailed output about the download process:

```
wget -v http://example.com/file.txt
```

### 20. **Simulate a Download (Dry Run)**

To simulate a download without actually downloading the file:

```
wget --spider http://example.com/file.txt
```

### Example: Download an Entire Website

```
wget -m -p -E -k -K -np http://example.com/
```

This command mirrors the entire site (including images, CSS, and JavaScript) while maintaining the correct structure and converting links for offline use.

`wget` is a versatile tool with many options, so be sure to check the man page (`man wget`) for additional details.

```bash
wget --user=username --password=password http://example.com/file.txt
```

### 14. **Download Files from a List and Mirror a Site**

You can mirror an entire website using several options to ensure it gets all files and directories:

```bash
wget -r -l inf --no-parent --convert-links --timestamping --limit-rate=100k http://example.com/
```

Explanation of options:

- `-r`: Recursively download files.
- `-l inf`: Set the recursion depth to infinite.
- `--no-parent`: Avoid downloading files from the parent directory.
- `--convert-links`: Convert links to local URLs for offline viewing.
- `--timestamping`: Only download files that are newer than local files.

### 15. **Download with Cookies**

You can pass cookies to the server using a cookie file:

```

This will set a connection timeout of 30 seconds and try up to 3 times if the download fails.

### 18. **Check the HTTP Response Headers**

If you just want to view the HTTP headers for a URL without downloading the file:

```bash
wget --server-response --spider http://example.com/file.txt
```

The `--spider` option checks the file without downloading it, and `--server-response` shows the HTTP headers.

### 19. **Quiet Mode**

If you want to suppress the output to only show errors or essential information:

```bash
wget -q http://example.com/file.txt
```

The `-q` flag suppresses all output.

### 20. **Download via HTTPS with SSL Verification Disabled**

For more details and advanced usage, you can check the manual page for `wget` by typing:

```bash
man wget
```

This will provide all the available options and detailed explanations.

The `wget` command is a powerful utility used in Unix-based systems (like Linux and macOS) to download files from the internet. It's typically used in the terminal or command line interface, and it's known for its ability to handle downloads efficiently and securely.

Here's an overview of the most common and useful `wget` commands:

### 1. **Basic Download**

To download a file from a URL:

```bash
wget http://example.com/file.txt
```

This command will download `file.txt` from `http://example.com/` and save it in the current directory.

### 2. **Download and Save with a Different Filename**

If you want to save the downloaded file under a different name:

```bash
wget -O newfile.txt http://example.com/file.txt
```

This saves the file as `newfile.txt`.

### 3. **Download in the Background**

To run `wget` in the background (so it doesn't block your terminal):

```bash
wget -b http://example.com/file.txt
```

The download will continue in the background, and a log file (`wget-log`) will be created to track the progress.

### 4. **Download Multiple Files**

You can download multiple files by specifying a list of URLs in a text file:

```bash
wget -i filelist.txt
```

Where `filelist.txt` contains the list of URLs to be downloaded, one per line.

### 5. **Resume an Interrupted Download**

If a download is interrupted, you can resume it with the `-c` (continue) option:

```bash
wget -c http://example.com/file.txt
```

This will resume the download from where it was interrupted.

### 6. **Download a Whole Website**

To download an entire website (for offline browsing), use the `-r` (recursive) option:

```bash
wget -r http://example.com/
```

This will download the website and all its linked resources. You can also limit the depth of recursion with the `-l` flag (e.g., `-l 3` for three levels).

### 7. **Limit Download Speed**

To avoid consuming too much bandwidth, you can limit the download speed:

```bash
wget --limit-rate=200k http://example.com/file.txt
```

This limits the download rate to 200 KB/s.

### 8. **Download Files in Quiet Mode**

If you want to suppress the output (only errors will be shown), you can use the `-q` option:

```bash
wget -q http://example.com/file.txt
```

### 9. **Download Files Using FTP**

You can use `wget` to download files via FTP:

```bash
wget ftp://example.com/file.txt
```

To specify a username and password for FTP authentication:

```bash
wget --ftp-user=username --ftp-password=password ftp://example.com/file.txt
```

### 10. **Download Files Using HTTP Authentication**

If the file is behind HTTP authentication (such as basic auth), use the `--user` and `--password` options:

```bash
wget --user=yourusername --password=yourpassword http://example.com/file.txt
```

### 11. **Download Files with Cookies**

Sometimes you may need to send cookies to the server for the request to be valid. Use the `--cookies` option:

```bash
wget --load-cookies=cookies.txt http://example.com/file.txt
```

This will send the cookies from the `cookies.txt` file.

### 12. **Set User-Agent String**

You can set a custom `User-Agent` string for the request (useful for mimicking a browser):

```bash
wget --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)" http://example.com/file.txt
```

### 13. **Download a File with Proxy**

If you're behind a proxy, you can use the `--proxy` option:

```bash
wget -e use_proxy=yes -e http_proxy=http://yourproxy.com:8080 http://example.com/file.txt
```

### 14. **Check URL for HTTP Response Status**

If you want to check the HTTP response status (e.g., 200 OK or 404 Not Found) without downloading the file:

```bash
wget --spider http://example.com/file.txt
```

This command checks if the file exists without downloading it.

### 15. **Mirror a Website with Download**

To mirror a website, use the following:

```bash

```

### Conclusion

These are some of the most common `wget` commands. There are many more advanced options you can use, and you can always explore the manual with `man wget` to learn about all available options.

The `wget` command is a powerful tool used for downloading files from the web, commonly used in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It supports a wide range of protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP. Here's an overview of common `wget` commands and options:

### Basic Syntax:

```bash
wget [options] [URL]
```

### Common `wget` Commands and Options:

1. **Download a Single File:**

   ```bash
   wget http://example.com/file.zip
   ```

   This downloads `file.zip` from `http://example.com`.

2. **Download a File and Save with a Different Name:**

   ```bash
   wget -O new_name.zip http://example.com/file.zip
   ```

   This saves the downloaded file as `new_name.zip`.

3. **Download Multiple Files:**

   ```bash
   wget -i filelist.txt
   ```

   This downloads all the URLs listed in `filelist.txt`.

4. **Resume a Download:**

   ```bash
   wget -c http://example.com/file.zip
   ```

   If the download was interrupted, this will resume from where it left off.

5. **Download Files in Background:**

   ```bash
   wget -b http://example.com/file.zip
   ```

   Downloads the file in the background, saving the output to `wget-log`.

6. **Limit Download Speed:**

   ```bash
   wget --limit-rate=200k http://example.com/file.zip
   ```

   Limits the download speed to 200 KB/s.

   ```bash
   wget -r http://example.com
   ```

   Downloads the entire website starting from `http://example.com`.

8. **Mirror a Website (with options for adjusting recursion depth and downloading necessary files):**

   ```bash
   wget -m -p -E http://example.com
   ```

   - `-m`: Mirror the website (includes recursion and timestamping).
   - `-p`: Download all necessary files (images, CSS, etc.).
   - `-E`: Adjust file extensions (e.g., `.html` for HTML pages).

9. **Download Only Specific File Types:**

   ```bash
   wget -r -A jpg,png http://example.com
   ```

   Downloads only `.jpg` and `.png` files.

10. **Set User-Agent:**

    ```bash
    wget --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0" http://example.com
    ```

    This changes the user agent string to mimic a web browser.

11. **Download via FTP:**

    ```bash
    wget ftp://username:password@ftp.example.com/file.txt
    ```

    Downloads a file from an FTP server with authentication.

12. **Download and Follow Redirects:**

    ```bash
    wget --max-redirect=5 http://example.com
    ```

    Follows up to 5 redirects before giving up.

13. **Check Website Availability (without downloading the full content):**

    ```bash
    wget --spider http://example.com
    ```

    This checks if the website is available, without actually downloading files.

14. **Download with Proxy Settings:**

    ```bash
    wget -e use_proxy=yes -e http_proxy=proxy.example.com:8080 http://example.com/file.zip

    This downloads a file requiring HTTP authentication.

16. **Set a Retry Limit:**

    ```bash
    wget --tries=3 http://example.com/file.zip
    ```

    Retries the download up to 3 times in case of failure.

17. **Download Files Using Cookies:**
    ```bash
    wget --load-cookies cookies.txt http://example.com/file.zip
    ```
    Downloads a file while using cookies stored in `cookies.txt`.

### Example Use Cases:

- **Download a Website for Offline Viewing:**

  ```bash
  wget -r -np -k http://example.com
  ```

  - `-np`: No parent (prevents downloading files from higher-level directories).
  - `-k`: Converts links to make them suitable for offline viewing.

- **Download Files from an FTP Server:**
  ```bash
  wget ftp://example.com/dir/*.zip
  ```
  Downloads all `.zip` files from the specified FTP directory.

Certainly! Here's a more detailed explanation of `wget` and its various options, including advanced features and configurations.

### Overview of `wget`

`wget` is a free and open-source command-line utility for downloading files from the web using HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols. It's useful for retrieving single files, mirroring entire websites, and automating downloads. Some of the key features include recursive downloads, support for resuming interrupted downloads, and the ability to download files in the background.

---

### **Detailed Options and Features:**

1. **Basic Usage and Downloading Files:**

   ```bash
   wget http://example.com/file.zip
   ```

   This command downloads a file from a given URL. The file will be saved with its original name (`file.zip` in this case).

2. **Download a File to a Different Filename:**

   ```bash
   wget -O newfile.zip http://example.com/file.zip
   ```

   Use the `-O` option to specify the output file name. In this case, it will save the file as `newfile.zip`.

3. **Download Multiple Files (from a List):**

   ```bash
   wget -i list_of_files.txt
   ```

   If you have a list of URLs stored in a text file (`list_of_files.txt`), you can download all the files in the list using the `-i` option.

4. **Download Files in the Background (Non-blocking):**

   ```bash
   wget -b http://example.com/file.zip
   ```

   The `-b` option downloads the file in the background, meaning the terminal will be freed up for other tasks. By default, output will be saved in a log file (`wget-log`).

5. **Resume an Interrupted Download:**

   ```bash
   wget -c http://example.com/file.zip
   ```

   If a download is interrupted (e.g., due to network failure), you can use the `-c` option to resume the download from where it was left off.

6. **Download Files with Rate Limiting:**

   ```bash
   wget --limit-rate=200k http://example.com/file.zip
   ```

   The `--limit-rate` option allows you to control the download speed. For example, this command limits the download speed to 200 KB per second.

7. **Download a Website (Recursive Downloads):**

   ```bash
   wget -r http://example.com
   ```

   The `-r` option tells `wget` to recursively download the website. It will download the page and all the linked resources (like images, CSS, JavaScript). You can add additional flags to control the depth of recursion.

   - **Limit Recursion Depth**:
     ```bash
     wget -r -l 2 http://example.com
     ```
     The `-l` option specifies the recursion level. In this example, it will follow links up to a depth of 2.

8. **Download a Website for Offline Viewing (Complete Site):**

   ```bash
   wget -m -p -E -k http://example.com
   ```

   - `-m`: Mirror the website (includes recursion, timestamping).
   - `-p`: Download all necessary files (images, stylesheets, etc.).
   - `-E`: Convert file extensions to `.html` for proper offline viewing.
   - `-k`: Convert the links in the downloaded files to make them suitable for offline browsing (relative links).

9. **Download Specific File Types:**

   ```bash
   wget -r -A pdf,jpg http://example.com
   ```

   The `-A` option specifies file types to accept. This example downloads only PDF and JPG files from the website.

10. **Download with Authentication (HTTP or FTP):**

    - **HTTP Authentication**:
      ```bash
      wget --user=username --password=password http://example.com/securefile.zip
      ```
      For sites requiring basic HTTP authentication, use `--user` and `--password` to provide credentials.
    - **FTP Authentication**:
      ```bash
      wget ftp://username:password@ftp.example.com/file.zip
      ```
      For FTP servers requiring authentication, include the username and password in the URL.

11. **Download Files Using Cookies:**

    ```bash
    wget --load-cookies cookies.txt http://example.com/file.zip
    ```

    If a website uses cookies for authentication or session tracking, you can use the `--load-cookies` option to load cookies from a file (`cookies.txt`) and use them during the download.

12. **Set Custom HTTP Headers or User-Agent:**

    ```bash
    wget --header="Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5" --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0" http://example.com/file.zip
    ```

    The `--header` option allows you to pass custom HTTP headers, and `--user-agent` allows you to set a custom user agent string (useful when you want to mimic a browser request).

13. **Limit Number of Retries:**

    ```bash
    wget --tries=5 http://example.com/file.zip
    ```

    This option specifies how many times `wget` should retry a download in case of failure. By default, `wget` retries indefinitely.

14. **Follow Redirects (Max Redirects):**

    ```bash
    wget --max-redirect=3 http://example.com
    ```

    The `--max-redirect` option limits the number of redirects `wget` will follow. By default, it follows an unlimited number of redirects, which may result in an infinite loop if misconfigured.

15. **Check File Existence (Spider Mode):**

    ```bash
    wget --spider http://example.com/file.zip
    ```

    The `--spider` option checks whether a file exists without downloading it. It’s useful for verifying the availability of a file.

16. **Download Files from an FTP Server with Passive Mode:**

    ```bash
    wget --ftp-password=password --ftp-user=username --passive-ftp ftp://example.com/file.zip
    ```

    This command downloads a file from an FTP server using passive mode. Passive FTP can be useful when dealing with firewalls that block active FTP connections.

17. **Download a List of URLs in Parallel (via `wget` and `xargs`):**

    ```bash
    cat urls.txt | xargs -n 1 -P 5 wget
    ```

    This combination uses `xargs` to download multiple URLs concurrently (in this case, up to 5 parallel downloads).

18. **Download an Entire FTP Directory (Recursively):**

    ```bash
    wget -r ftp://ftp.example.com/directory/
    ```

    The `-r` option enables recursion, so `wget` downloads all files in the specified FTP directory and its subdirectories.

19. **Download Files with a Proxy:**

    ```bash
    wget -e use_proxy=yes -e http_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080 http://example.com/file.zip
    ```

    You can specify a proxy server for your download using `-e use_proxy=yes` and setting the proxy address with `-e http_proxy`.

20. **Download a File to a Specified Directory:**
    ```bash
    wget -P /path/to/directory http://example.com/file.zip
    ```
    The `-P` option lets you specify the destination directory for the downloaded file.

### **Advanced Features:**

1. **Download Files from a Website while Preserving Directory Structure:**

   ```bash
   wget -nH --cut-dirs=1 -r -l inf http://example.com/dir/
   ```

   - `-nH`: Avoid creating a directory structure that mirrors the domain name.
   - `--cut-dirs=1`: Skips one level of directory creation.
   - `-l inf`: Infinite recursion depth.

2. **Download Only Files Modified After a Certain Date:**

   ```bash
   wget --timestamping http://example.com/file.zip
   ```

   This command downloads the file only if the local file is older than the version on the server.

3. **Log Output and Errors:**
   ```bash
   wget -o download.log -e robots=off http://example.com/file.zip
   ```
   - `-o`: Logs download details to a file (`download.log`).
   - `-e robots=off`: Ignores the robots.txt file (which usually disallows web scraping).

---

### **Troubleshooting Tips:**

- **Connection Issues or Timeouts**: Use the `--timeout` and `--tries` options to manage timeouts and retries.
- **404 Errors**: Ensure the URL is correct. If the resource requires authentication, use the correct login credentials.
- **Too Many Redirects**: Use the `--max-redirect` option to avoid excessive redirects.
- **Large Files**: Use `-c` to resume the download if interrupted.

---

### **Conclusion:**

`wget` is a powerful and flexible tool that can be used for a wide range of tasks, from downloading individual files to recursively mirroring entire websites. It supports various protocols and provides numerous options for controlling the download process, such as rate limiting, retries, and custom headers.

For more information, you can always refer to the man pages (`man wget`) or the official [GNU Wget Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html).

Sure! Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the `wget` command with a focus on its features, options, and use cases. We’ll cover more advanced options and practical examples as well.

### **Basic Usage**

1. **Download a File:**

   ```bash
   wget http://example.com/file.zip
   ```

   Downloads the file from the provided URL and saves it with its original name.

2. **Specify Output Filename (`-O`):**

   ```bash
   wget -O newfile.zip http://example.com/file.zip
   ```

   This option allows you to save the file with a different name.

3. **Download a File in Background (`-b`):**

   ```bash
   wget -b http://example.com/file.zip
   ```

   Downloads the file in the background and logs the output to a file called `wget-log`.

4. **Resume a Download (`-c`):**

   ```bash
   wget -c http://example.com/file.zip
   ```

   Resumes a previous download if it was interrupted, starting from the last byte received.

5. **Limit Download Speed (`--limit-rate`):**
   ```bash
   wget --limit-rate=500k http://example.com/file.zip
   ```
   Restricts the download speed to 500 KB/s to avoid consuming too much bandwidth.

---

### **Advanced Options**

#### **1. Recursive Download (`-r`)**

Downloads files recursively from a website.

```bash
wget -r http://example.com/
```

This command will start downloading the webpage and follow links on the page to download other pages, images, and assets linked from it.

**Important Recursive Options:**

- `-l depth`: Limit the depth of recursion (e.g., `-l 2` to limit the recursion to two levels).
- `-np` (no-parent): Ensures that files from parent directories are not downloaded.
- `-nH` (no-host-directories): Avoids creating a directory with the same name as the website's domain.
- `-k` (convert-links): Converts the links to local links suitable for offline viewing.

Example:

```bash
wget -r -l 2 -np -k http://example.com/
```

Downloads the website and converts all internal links for offline browsing up to a depth of 2, without fetching parent directory files.

#### **2. Mirroring a Website (`-m` or `--mirror`)**

This is a more specific form of recursive downloading, which includes several options for mirroring a site:

```bash
wget -m http://example.com/
```

This enables:

- `-r`: Recursion.
- `-l inf`: Infinite recursion depth.
- `-N`: Only download files that are newer than the local copy.
- `-np`: Prevents moving to parent directories.
- `-P`: Specifies the directory to store files.

**Example with additional options:**

```bash
wget -m -np -k -E http://example.com/
```

- `-E`: Adjusts file extensions (e.g., `.html` for HTML files).

#### **3. Downloading Specific File Types (`-A`, `-R`)**

You can specify file types you want to include or exclude during recursive downloads:

- **`-A`**: Accept only specific file types (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`).
- **`-R`**: Reject certain file types (e.g., `.gif`).

Example:

```bash
wget -r -A jpg,png http://example.com/
```

This command will download only `.jpg` and `.png` files from the website.

#### **4. Downloading from FTP Servers**

`wget` supports downloading files from FTP servers as well.

- **FTP with credentials:**

  ```bash
  wget ftp://username:password@ftp.example.com/file.zip
  ```

- **Anonymous FTP download:**

  ```bash
  wget ftp://ftp.example.com/file.zip
  ```

- **Download all files from a directory:**
  ```bash
  wget -r ftp://ftp.example.com/directory/
  ```

#### **5. Downloading with HTTP Authentication (`--user`, `--password`)**

If the file is behind HTTP authentication (Basic Auth), you can use the `--user` and `--password` options.

```bash
wget --user=username --password=password http://example.com/securefile.zip
```

#### **6. Using a Proxy (`--proxy`)**

You can configure `wget` to use a proxy server.

```bash
wget --proxy=on --proxy-user=username --proxy-password=password http://example.com/file.zip
```

#### **7. Handling Redirects (`--max-redirect`)**

Sometimes URLs redirect to another URL. By default, `wget` follows up to 20 redirects, but you can change this limit.

```bash
wget --max-redirect=5 http://example.com/
```

#### **8. Downloading Files Using Cookies (`--load-cookies`)**

If a website requires cookies (for example, to handle login sessions), you can pass cookies stored in a file:

```bash
wget --load-cookies=cookies.txt http://example.com/file.zip
```

To save cookies to a file, use `--save-cookies`:

```bash
wget --save-cookies=cookies.txt http://example.com/login
```

#### **9. Check if a URL Exists (Spider Mode)**

Use `--spider` to check if the resource exists, without downloading it.

```bash
wget --spider http://example.com/file.zip
```

This is useful for verifying links on a website or checking if a file exists.

---

### **Examples of Complex Usage**

1. **Downloading a Website for Offline Use (with complex options):**

   ```bash
   wget -r -np -k -l 3 -E -P /local/directory http://example.com/
   ```

   - `-r`: Recursively download.
   - `-np`: Don't go to parent directories.
   - `-k`: Convert links for offline browsing.
   - `-l 3`: Limit depth to 3 levels.
   - `-E`: Adjust file extensions to `.html`.
   - `-P /local/directory`: Save the files in a specified directory.

2. **Download Multiple Files Listed in a Text File:**
   If you have a list of URLs saved in a file (`urls.txt`), you can download them all at once:

   ```bash
   wget -i urls.txt
   ```

3. **Download Files from an FTP Server with Passive Mode:**
   FTP servers often require passive mode for transfers. To enable it, use the `--ftp-passive` option:
   ```bash
   wget --ftp-passive ftp://ftp.example.com/file.zip
   ```

---

### **More Tips**

- **Retry Download if Failed:**

  ```bash
  wget --tries=5 http://example.com/file.zip
  ```

  This will retry the download up to 5 times if it fails.

- **Download a Single Page (with all assets like images, CSS, JS):**

  ```bash
  wget -p -k http://example.com/page.html
  ```

  - `-p`: Download all necessary assets (images, stylesheets, scripts, etc.) for the page.

- **Download a Specific Range of Bytes:**
  ```bash
  wget --header="Range: bytes=1000-2000" http://example.com/file.zip
  ```
  Downloads only the range of bytes from 1000 to 2000 from the file.
