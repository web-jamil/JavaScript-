# Valid Identifiers
age = 25  # Variable identifier
name = "John"  # Variable identifier
is_active = True  # Variable identifier (snake_case)
user_count = 100  # Variable identifier (snake_case)
_underscore_var = 10  # Valid identifier starting with an underscore

# Function Identifier
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    return a + b  # Function identifier, descriptive of its purpose

# Class Identifier (CamelCase)
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance variable identifier
        self.age = age  # Instance variable identifier

    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old."

# Using the identifiers in code
person1 = Person("Alice", 30)  # Object identifier
person2 = Person("Bob", 25)

print(person1.greet())  # Using method identifier
print(person2.greet())  # Using method identifier

total = calculate_sum(5, 10)  # Using function identifier
print(total)  # Output will be 15

""" In Python, identifiers are names used to identify variables, functions, classes, modules, or other objects. An identifier is essentially any name you give to a Python object, and it follows certain naming rules and conventions.

Python Identifier Rules
Identifiers can include:

Letters (a-z, A-Z)
Digits (0-9), but not as the first character
Underscore (_)
Identifiers must start with:

A letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
Identifiers cannot start with:

A digit (0-9).
Identifiers are case-sensitive:

variable, Variable, and VARIABLE are considered different identifiers.
Reserved words (keywords):

You cannot use Python's reserved keywords (such as if, else, while, etc.) as identifiers.
Length:

There is no limit on the length of an identifier, but it is best practice to use meaningful and readable names.
Python Identifier Best Practices
Use descriptive names: Choose names that describe the role of the variable or function (e.g., age, total_cost).
Snake case for variables: Use underscores between words (e.g., total_amount, first_name).
Camel case for classes: Capitalize the first letter of each word (e.g., MyClass, CarModel).
Avoid single character names: Except for counters or iterators (e.g., i, j, k). """
