In Python, **comparison operators** are used to compare two values. They evaluate a condition and return a Boolean value (`True` or `False`). Here's a detailed breakdown of all the comparison operators and their syntaxes:

### **Comparison Operators in Python**

| **Operator** | **Name**             | **Description**                                           | **Example**                          | **Result**     |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| `==`         | Equal to             | Returns `True` if the values on both sides are equal.     | `a == b`                             | `True` or `False` |
| `!=`         | Not equal to         | Returns `True` if the values on both sides are not equal. | `a != b`                             | `True` or `False` |
| `>`          | Greater than         | Returns `True` if the left value is greater than the right. | `a > b`                             | `True` or `False` |
| `<`          | Less than            | Returns `True` if the left value is less than the right.  | `a < b`                             | `True` or `False` |
| `>=`         | Greater than or equal to | Returns `True` if the left value is greater than or equal to the right. | `a >= b`                           | `True` or `False` |
| `<=`         | Less than or equal to | Returns `True` if the left value is less than or equal to the right. | `a <= b`                           | `True` or `False` |
| `is`         | Identity comparison  | Returns `True` if both variables refer to the same object in memory. | `a is b`                             | `True` or `False` |
| `is not`     | Identity not equal   | Returns `True` if both variables do not refer to the same object in memory. | `a is not b`                         | `True` or `False` |

### **Detailed Explanations with Code Examples:**

#### 1. **Equal to (`==`)**
Compares the values of two operands, returning `True` if they are equal, otherwise `False`.

```python
a = 10
b = 10
print(a == b)  # True because a and b are equal
```

#### 2. **Not equal to (`!=`)**
Checks if two operands are not equal. Returns `True` if the values are different.

```python
a = 10
b = 20
print(a != b)  # True because a and b are not equal
```

#### 3. **Greater than (`>`)**
Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand. Returns `True` if the left value is larger.

```python
a = 15
b = 10
print(a > b)  # True because 15 is greater than 10
```

#### 4. **Less than (`<`)**
Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand. Returns `True` if the left value is smaller.

```python
a = 5
b = 10
print(a < b)  # True because 5 is less than 10
```

#### 5. **Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**
Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand. Returns `True` if the left value is either greater or equal.

```python
a = 10
b = 10
print(a >= b)  # True because 10 is equal to 10
```

#### 6. **Less than or equal to (`<=`)**
Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand. Returns `True` if the left value is either smaller or equal.

```python
a = 5
b = 10
print(a <= b)  # True because 5 is less than 10
```

#### 7. **Identity comparison (`is`)**
Checks if two variables point to the same object in memory, not just if their values are equal. Returns `True` if they refer to the same object.

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
print(a is b)  # True because both a and b refer to the same object in memory

c = [1, 2, 3]
print(a is c)  # False because a and c are different objects in memory
```

#### 8. **Identity not equal (`is not`)**
Checks if two variables do not point to the same object in memory. Returns `True` if they refer to different objects.

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
print(a is not b)  # False because a and b refer to the same object in memory

c = [1, 2, 3]
print(a is not c)  # True because a and c are different objects in memory
```

### **Example: Using Comparison Operators in Conditional Statements**

```python
x = 5
y = 10

if x == 5:
    print("x is 5")  # This condition is True

if x != y:
    print("x is not equal to y")  # This condition is True

if x > 3:
    print("x is greater than 3")  # This condition is True

if y <= 10:
    print("y is less than or equal to 10")  # This condition is True

if x is not y:
    print("x and y are not the same object")  # This condition is True
```

This provides a comprehensive overview of all the **comparison operators** in Python, their syntax, and usage examples.


Comparison operators in Python are used to compare values or expressions. They return a Boolean result (`True` or `False`). Here's a more in-depth explanation of each comparison operator, including its syntax, behavior, and examples:

### **1. Equal to (`==`)**
The equality operator checks whether two values are equal.

#### **Syntax**:
```python
a == b
```

- **Returns**: `True` if the values of `a` and `b` are equal, otherwise `False`.
- **Use case**: This is the most common operator used when you need to check if two variables or expressions are equivalent.

#### **Example**:
```python
x = 10
y = 10
print(x == y)  # Output: True because 10 is equal to 10

a = 'hello'
b = 'world'
print(a == b)  # Output: False because 'hello' is not equal to 'world'
```

---

### **2. Not equal to (`!=`)**
The inequality operator checks whether two values are not equal.

#### **Syntax**:
```python
a != b
```

- **Returns**: `True` if the values of `a` and `b` are not equal, otherwise `False`.
- **Use case**: Use this operator when you want to verify that two values are distinct.

#### **Example**:
```python
x = 10
y = 20
print(x != y)  # Output: True because 10 is not equal to 20

a = 'apple'
b = 'banana'
print(a != b)  # Output: True because 'apple' is not equal to 'banana'
```

---

### **3. Greater than (`>`)**
The greater-than operator checks if the left value is greater than the right value.

#### **Syntax**:
```python
a > b
```

- **Returns**: `True` if the value of `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise `False`.
- **Use case**: This is often used to compare numerical values and check which one is larger.

#### **Example**:
```python
x = 15
y = 10
print(x > y)  # Output: True because 15 is greater than 10

a = 5
b = 5
print(a > b)  # Output: False because 5 is not greater than 5
```

---

### **4. Less than (`<`)**
The less-than operator checks if the left value is smaller than the right value.

#### **Syntax**:
```python
a < b
```

- **Returns**: `True` if the value of `a` is smaller than `b`, otherwise `False`.
- **Use case**: This is used when you need to compare two values and check if one is less than the other.

#### **Example**:
```python
x = 5
y = 10
print(x < y)  # Output: True because 5 is less than 10

a = 20
b = 15
print(a < b)  # Output: False because 20 is not less than 15
```

---

### **5. Greater than or equal to (`>=`)**
The greater-than-or-equal-to operator checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.

#### **Syntax**:
```python
a >= b
```

- **Returns**: `True` if the value of `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, otherwise `False`.
- **Use case**: This is useful for checking if a value meets a threshold or boundary condition.

#### **Example**:
```python
x = 10
y = 5
print(x >= y)  # Output: True because 10 is greater than 5

a = 5
b = 5
print(a >= b)  # Output: True because 5 is equal to 5
```

---

### **6. Less than or equal to (`<=`)**
The less-than-or-equal-to operator checks if the left value is smaller than or equal to the right value.

#### **Syntax**:
```python
a <= b
```

- **Returns**: `True` if the value of `a` is smaller than or equal to `b`, otherwise `False`.
- **Use case**: This is often used in scenarios where you need to check if a value is within a certain range.

#### **Example**:
```python
x = 5
y = 10
print(x <= y)  # Output: True because 5 is less than 10

a = 5
b = 5
print(a <= b)  # Output: True because 5 is equal to 5
```

---

### **7. Identity comparison (`is`)**
The `is` operator checks if two variables point to the same object in memory (i.e., they are the same object).

#### **Syntax**:
```python
a is b
```

- **Returns**: `True` if both `a` and `b` are the same object in memory, otherwise `False`.
- **Use case**: This operator is used when you need to compare objects and determine if they are the same instance, not just if they are equal in value.

#### **Example**:
```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x
print(x is y)  # Output: True because x and y refer to the same object in memory

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
print(a is b)  # Output: False because a and b are different objects in memory, even though they are equal in value
```

---

### **8. Identity not equal (`is not`)**
The `is not` operator checks if two variables do not point to the same object in memory.

#### **Syntax**:
```python
a is not b
```

- **Returns**: `True` if `a` and `b` are not the same object in memory, otherwise `False`.
- **Use case**: This operator is used when you need to ensure that two variables are not the same object, even if they may be equal in value.

#### **Example**:
```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x
print(x is not y)  # Output: False because x and y refer to the same object

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [1, 2, 3]
print(a is not b)  # Output: True because a and b are different objects in memory
```

### **How to Use Comparison Operators in Conditional Statements:**
Comparison operators are often used in `if`, `elif`, and `while` statements to control the flow of execution based on conditions.

#### **Example**:
```python
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")

# Output: You are an adult.
```
